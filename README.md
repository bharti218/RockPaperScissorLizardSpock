# Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock
Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock implemented in Unity. It's an extended version of the classic Rock Paper Scissor game with two more elements: Lizard and Spock. It is a single-player game played against the computer.

## Implementation Details:
I implemented the Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock game using State Pattern. Each move can be viewed as a State. Each State defeats two other states. So there are five possible states because there are five possible moves. 
Once the player plays a move I get a random move for the computer and then compare if one move kills another. 

## GameConfig:
MaxTime: maximum time value for the player to play. 
Reward: reward given on winning.
