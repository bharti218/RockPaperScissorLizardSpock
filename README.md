## Implementation Details:
I implemented Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock game using State Pattern. Each move can be viewed as a State. Each State defeats two other states. So there are five possible states because there are five possible moves. 
Once the player plays a move I get a random for computer too and the compare if one move kills another. 

#GameConfig:
MaxTime: maximum time value for player to play. 
Reward: reward given on winning.
